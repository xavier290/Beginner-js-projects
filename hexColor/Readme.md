For the first project i made a hex color app background changing.
This is actually pretty easy, and i did it following this article:
https://dev.to/codefoxx/15-beginner-javascript-projects-to-improve-your-front-end-skills-5bcj
where the senior developer "Miguel Nunez" recommends doing 15 projects to improve your front-end skills, so i basically said why not?

Okay, let's go to the point, in this project we have two main things that i will be explaining in order to have it working, where the first one is:

# Our HTML file:

   <img src="hexColor\images\Screenshot (266).png">

# and our Js file:

    where all of our logic will be implemented to change the background color.
